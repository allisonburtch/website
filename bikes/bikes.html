<h2>Bike Stuff</h2>
<br>
I love riding bikes. 
<br><br>
In the summer of 2008 I co-led a bike tour in Europe. Six teenage boys from Amsterdam to Paris. I laughed a lot. 
<br><br>
In 2009 I biked from New York City to Los Angeles as part of a tour for the Bicycle Film Festival and 42 Below Vodka, the sponsor of the festival. It was supposed to be a vodka marketing tour but really ended up being the best summer of my life and one of the reasons I moved to NYC.
<br><br>
In 2010, I briefly worked for <a href="http://www.rapha.cc/cycle-club/">Rapha</a> at their pop-up store on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowery">Bowery</a> in NYC.
<br><br>
In <a href="http://www.good.is/posts/cat-6-competitive-commuting-turns-bike-rides-into-races/
">an article</a> for <em>GOOD Magazine</em>, I labelled competitive bike commuting "Cat 6" racing, a reference to competitive cycling in which one begins in Category 5 and progresses to Category 1. The New York Times referenced the <a href="http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/17/cat-6-and-competitive-commuting/
">terminology</a> and <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE4DD1630F931A25751C1A9669D8B63
">article</a> twice.

In 2011 I did an loop around the Adirondacks. Had some stupid bike problems, hitch-hiked to the next town (which had a Walmart but not a bike shop) and ended up finishing the tour with a race saddle and Look Keos on a shitty ass front-suspenion Walmart mountain bike.
<br><br>
In 2012 I did a month-long solo tour from Boston to Prince Edward Island, took a train to Montreal and then biked back.
